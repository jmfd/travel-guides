Chocolate tasting; I haven't been but I heard it was pretty good.

The saimen is the best I've had in hawaii.  Their Mai Tai is pretty good too.

One of the better modern restaurants, they seem to actually experiment a little :).

Not overrated fish house. Make reservations early, try to make sure you can get a view near the ocean.

Pretty good restaurant, haven't had a dish here I didn't like.

Nice little valley area between mountains

If the season is right, taking a ~2 hour smooth boat ride to chase whales is a lot of fun!

I know you can find the coconut hiwa porter in the bay area, but why not go to the brewery and try it fresh?

One of the better roasters in maui. Honolulu Coffee Company will also get the job done. There might be some others I haven't explored.

By itself maybe not worth the trip, but its next door neighbor makes it a great 2-for-1:

There's a nice distillery tour that's also quick and then you can sample.  (across the street is also this restaurant, which is decent: https://hgsmaui.com)

Some other things to do:
- Get shave ice (I go to Ululani's, but you can probably find others that are as good/better)

Snorkeling
You don't really need a boat to molokini, there's tons of snorkeling off certain coasts like near wailea. Tons of amazing sea life to see.

Surfing
So much fun, so much work.

Road to Hana
Umm... this is a whole day and a shitton of driving.  Do go the back way, it is beautiful at sunset. But also get an app and take tons of adventures. Probably not worth it for a short trip if it is so much driving.

Pia'a
Hippie town-ish... feels more like something for tourists really. Can skip.

Food trunks near kamaole beach park
Not worth a special trip, but if you're there already get some hawaiian plates from the food truck.
