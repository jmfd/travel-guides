# Tokyo

Tokyo is the most impressive city I've seen; it puts NYC to shame.  Tokyo itself is split up into several different wards, each with their own personality and things to do.  I enjoyed getting off the metro at a random stop and just exploring around.  Sometimes I'd encounter shinto shrines or just marvel at the architecture the residential areas.    Tokyo is very pedestrian friendly &mdash; you can walk around virtually anywhere, though sometimes you share a single road (no sidewalk) with cars, so make sure to not stray too far from the side of the road.  A silver lexus hit me with their side view mirror when I wasn't paying attention.  Most subway stops are less than half a mile apart, so it is easy to get around.  Definitely get a prepaid green "suica" card so you don't have to buy metro tickets all the time.  This map is your best friend (bring copies!): [http://bento.com/pix/subway/tokyo\_subway\_1700.gif](http://bento.com/pix/subway/tokyo_subway_1700.gif)

Tokyo is also extremely safe &mdash; there's only two areas I would avoid at night: downtown Roppongi and Kabukicho in Shinjuku.  Roppongi is an international district with many foreign embassies.  At night there are nigerian hustlers that tried to coerce me to go into overpriced bars; but if you don't acknowledge them initially they'll leave you alone.  Kabukicho is a red light district where the Yakuza congregate.  Even with this, I saw many women walk around alone at night in these areas.  They don't really have much to fear as the crime rate is ridiculously low.

Food is of course a main reason to go to Japan!  Most restaurants have a single focus, whether it is an eel shop, tempura shop, ramen shop, soba shop, sushi shop, katsu shop, etc.  They refine this category to perfection.  Don't rathole on eating sushi; it is more consistent than what you can find here but not necessarily better.  The best expression I learned was "kyo no osusume de kudasai," which means, "give me today's special."  I always ended up with something great.  Onigiri was the comfort food of choice, you can find these to go all over the place, and even the ones at 7-11 were awesome.

If you're staying for more than 2 weeks, I recommend getting an apartment.  I got mine from [http://www.tokyoapartments.jp/](http://www.tokyoapartments.jp/).  They will say whether or not they have a bilingual staff.  It is pretty nice having a washer/dryer for clothes so you don't have to bring tons of stuff.  Airbnb might also be a good way to go.  Also, when you book your flight, definitely go with a japanese airline (JAL or ANA).  Much better service and free booze :).

Cash is the currency of choice, though some places will take credit card.  When I needed to refuel my gangster roll, I got cash from a 7-11 ATM.  They're everywhere.  There was about a 1% surcharge on the conversion, which is much better than what you'll get at the airport exchange places.  I usually averaged carrying around ~30,000 yen (300 dollars) worth of cash.  Don't be shy about paying with coins otherwise they'll accumulate.

Late March is a great time to go to Japan because of all the cherry blossoms.  If you choose the right areas, there's really nothing like it, especially when you get caught in a petal blizzard.

## Shibuya
Shibuya is perhaps the most exciting ward with lots to see and do from a culture shaped by young people.  A popular meetup area is the "Hachiko" dog shrine; the dog's master at some point died (war?) yet the loyal pup waited at the station every day for 10 years for him to return.  Now it is where all the cool kids hang out!  The first thing you'll notice outside the station is Shibuya crossing, which is the largest scramble-style pedestrian crossing in the world.  I don't remember the stat, but I think something like 3 million people pass through there in a day.  It is the Times Square of Tokyo.  Across the intersection is the Shibuya 109 department store, which is something like 9 stories of the most fashionable girl's clothing.  Seriously, you should stop by just to oogle at the girls.

Harajuku (as in from Gwen Stefani's "Harajuku Girls" is also a stop away from the main Shibuya station.  The crazy cosplayers come out in force on Sundays at Takeshita street.  Also in the area is the Meiji shrine, which is one of the few major shrines I recommend visiting in Tokyo.

One of the new food trends I discovered on my last trip was "gyukatsu." You could say this is like tonkatsu with beef instead of pork, but the preparation is a little different. It is quickly fried and then you can cook the edges on a hot stone. It is served with different salts/sauces and a barley rice with mountain yam sides.  I recommend trying this new trend at [Gyukatsu Motomura](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d7898108-Reviews-Gyukatsu_Motomura_Shibuya-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html).

If you want to escape the flashy commercialism of Shibuya and escape to a more upscale hipster book store, I recommend the Daikanyama T-Site [TSUTAYA Books](http://real.tsite.jp/daikanyama/english/) location. There's a nice cafe; feel free to bring a laptop and you may even escape the hustly and bustle of tokyo for a while.

## Shinjuku
Shinjuku is another hopping area, a bit more on commercial side with a few skyscrapers and a very large train station.  Just outside the train station are several restaurants for wary travelers.  Eat some ramen at an outdoor stall.  I recall there being several Japanese department stores in this ward.  These are 10x more ridiculous that american department stores, and should definitely be visited.  The lower/basement floors are generally grocery store areas, but in no known definition &mdash; they are more like perfume counters but peddling the most exquisitely produced foods.  This makes them a great place to get a bento or mochi treat.  The middle floors are generally shopping (clothes, electronics, etc).  The second-to-top floor is good restaurants and the top floor is great restaurants.  Eat at Katsukura in the Takashimaya department store.  The katsu you find in Japan is thickly breaded and can be ordered in grades of pork quality.  I have not found any US equivalents.  At the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku is the "Lost in Translation" bar, worth having a drink at.

The must-go place in Shinjuku is a small area with historically old buildings a few blocks from the train station called the Golden Gai district.  Notable here is the over 200 bars and small restaurants you can eat from.  Each seats about 6 people and is themed differently.  Check this video out: [http://www.g4tv.com/videos/50526/tokyo-nightlife-with-alex-sim-wise/](http://www.g4tv.com/videos/50526/tokyo-nightlife-with-alex-sim-wise/)

In a similar vein, Piss Alley is an even smaller old side street, but dedicated to yakitori. You'll be in cramped seating thigh-to-thight with tourists or locals and smothering your clothes in grill smoke.  I'm not sure if the experience is Japan of the old or that from Blade Runner.

## Roppongi
Roppongi has a new area called Roppongi Hills which has expensive house and shopping.  I believe the second tallest building in Tokyo is here, at the top are some neat modern art exhibits and a way to get on the roof and see the city in 360 degrees.  The view is amazing &mdash; even from these heights you can't see an end to Tokyo.  From the roof, you may spot an area dense in Cherry Blossoms, this is Aoyama cemetary.  If they are in bloom, head directly there, do not pass go, do not collect $200.

## Akihabara
Akihabara, the Electric City, is the otaku capital.  Here you'll find anime billboards and girls dressed as french maids trying to escort you into cafes.  The electronic department stores are multiple floors to behold.  One uniquely japanese thing to do is to go to a cat cafe &mdash; here you can get tea/coffee and pet cute kittens.  The novelty does wear off after a bit, but I'd at least stop by this area for a couple hours.

## Shinodome/Odaiba
Shinodome's "Shio City" is relatively new and the most futuristic area of Tokyo.  Take a walk around here.  This is also where you can take the monorail to Odaiba, the artificial island.  Odaiba has a beach and boardwalk.  You can rent a dog and go shopping with it for the day (I didn't do this though).  There's also some interesting futuristic architecture on this island.

## Shinagawa
There's an aged sake bar called [Shusaron](http://osakelist.com/en/shusaron-aged-sake-specialty-bar-in-shinagawa/) worth visiting.

## Ginza
Ginza is a fancy shopping district.  From a tourist perspective, it is notable for having a Kabuki theate. This is a cornerstone of Japanese culture, but I found it a bit boring and would skip especially if you have limited time travelling.  If you are in the neighborhood, Ginza does have a michelin-starred Katsu restaurant called [Katsuzen](https://thosewhowandr.com/blog/michelin-star-tokyo-katsuzen).  Go for lunch for reasonable prices.  Can you tell I love Japanese katsu???

## Tsukuji
Home of the infamous fish market.  If you go, get up VERY early (5am?) otherwise you'll miss the action like we did.  Even so, you won't feel welcomed and likely get nearly hit by the fork lifts or flying fish.  The restaurant inside the market called "Daiwa Sushi" has the reputation of being the best/freshest sushi in Japan, at the very least I hear it makes an awesome breakfast.

## Asakusa
This is a touristy area with a large shrine.  It was under renovation when I went, so you may want to check ahead of time.  If you do go, get some tempura friend mochi from one of the street vendors.  There's an area just off the shrine path called "shitamachi" (roughly old town) which has a lot of out door izakaya pubs.  They're really fun, just sit at one of the benches, order some beer and food, and make friends with others doing the same.  This area is also known for their tempura restaurants.

## Ueno
Home of Ueno park and several museums.  I skipped the museums, but did hang out at the park.  There were several street performers and it was really fun, but I'm not sure if I just happened on some sort of festival/special day.

## Other things to do, but I would probably skip if I were there a limited time
- Visit the Imperial Palace in Chiyoda (pretty gardens, but not much else)
- Go to Edo Museum (the building itself is architecturally cool, but only worth seeing if you're a japanese history buff)
- Yoyogi Park (home to olympic games, but just not that pretty of a park!)
- Gyoza Stadium/Ice Cream City (sounds amazing, but costs a lot to get in and it is more for kids).  That said, Ikebukuro where it is located is pretty cool.

## If you only have a limited amount of time, do not pass these things up (all mentioned above):
- Visiting Takeshita street in Harajuku on a sunday to see people all costumed
- Going to the Golden Gai in Shinjuku district for drinks
- Seeing a 360 view of Tokyo at Roppongi Hills Tower (and visiting their modern art museum)

## Things you may have seen elsewhere but should skip
- Harmonica Alley. There's not much here and its atmosphere is standard. Instead do the above mentioned Piss Alley or Golden Gai.
