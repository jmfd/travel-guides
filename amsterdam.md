# Amsterdam

Definitely rent a fixie bike if you are a good biker, best way to get around

### Top recommendations:

* Foodhallen - hipster place to casually dine
* Tales & Spirits - excellent cocktails and small bites
* Cafe de Klos - ridiculously good (and surprising) BBQ
* Red Light District fri/sat late night - window shopping is an interesting look at human kind
* Vondelpark - walk around beautiful area and I think there's a beer garden there too
* De Kas - excellent fine dining
* Metropolitan - get Poffertjes

### Other things I enjoyed:

* Herring Stall Jonk - little place to get fresh herring and pickles!
* Pllek - cool shipping container restaurant on a beach on the other side of the river
* Broodjeszaak "'t Kuyltje" - grab an Ossenworst sandwich
* Monk Bouldergym - rock climbing and then grab a beer outside
* Oosterpark Caf√©-Restaurant - nice environment and good late lunch food/drinks
* Restaurant C - interesting food based on different temperatures
* Stroopwaffel from the farmer's market in De Pijp
